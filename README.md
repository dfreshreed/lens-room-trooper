# üîç Lens API Python

A Python script (`update_room_data.py`) that reads room metadata from a CSV file and adds or updates room records programmatically using the Lens API `upsertRoom` mutation.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Reads room data from a CSV file
- Authenticates using OAuth2 client credentials
- Sends the `upsertRoom` mutation to update room metadata
- Colorized output for logging and error reporting

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `requests`, `pandas`, `python-dotenv`, `coloredlogs`, `pygments`

Install all requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Steps

To use the script, follow these setup steps (in order):

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfreshreed/lens-api-python.git
cd lens-api-python
```

2. Setup virtual environment

Setting up a virtual environment is important to prevent dependency conflicts and avoid distrupting your global Python install.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set environment variables

Copy the template and fill in your API credentials

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```bash
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
SITE_ID=your-site-id
```

#### üìÇ CSV Format

Your `room_data.csv` should contain the following headers:

```
id,capacity,size,floor
```

Each row represents one room to update. The `room_data.csv` included in this repo contains four rows of example data. You don't have to edit or use this `.csv`. However, if you're replacing the file included in this project, make sure your columns match the expected format and rename it to `room_data.csv` (the script expects that `.csv` file name).

Expected types and data format:

| Column     | Type    | Description                                                |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`       | String  | The unique Lens-generated room ID                          |
| `capacity` | Integer | Maximum number of people the room can accommodate          |
| `size`     | Enum    | One of: NONE, FOCUS, HUDDLE, SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE          |
| `floor`    | String  | Name of the floor the room is on (e.g. "1", "2nd", "Main") |

## üß† Usage

After you've added your `.env` variables and updated the `room_data.csv` file, run:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python update_room_data.py
```

## üß™ Example Output

```bash
2025-05-20 09:15:11 dfr-machine.local __main__[84359] INFO Row 0 updated:
{
  "data": {
    "upsertRoom": {
      "name": "Room 1",
      "id": "8f366119-...a",
      "capacity": 4,
      "size": "SMALL",
      "updatedAt": "2025-05-06T21:27:15.589Z",
      "floor": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

Never commit your `.env` file. It's already been added to the .gitignore for safety.
